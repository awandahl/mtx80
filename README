Hi Peder,

I have revised the software to add the shutdown after 3 hours.
I measured a current of 2.2mA after shutdown.

I have compiled with standard settings. You can edit and re-compile as before, as you want.

In the 'constants' section.
     You can change the shutdown time.
    The line with  'timeLimit=18;' sets the run time to 3 hours. The hours have to be multiplied by 6, because it counts in 10min units

In the section  EEPROM LOAD 
      You can change the default callsign from 'ARDF'
      I have added SM0GMS and SM0HPL options.
      Edit, so only one line starts with '#rom '
      All others should start with '//' , which makes the whole line a comment statement and is ignored when compiling.

.In the 'void hunt_ini(void)' function section
   line 282: change nfoxes=2; to nfoxes=3;
   line 287: similar

hope that helps
